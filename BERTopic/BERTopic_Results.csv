"The present invention relates to an access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server and a method thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server and the method thereof, which prevent performance degradation of a web application server by automatically mapping a relation between a uniform resource locator (URL) request and a structured query language (SQL) request transmitted based on the URL request by the web application server receiving the URL request through session connection with a user terminal, without using a resource of the web application server. The access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server obtains the URL request and the SQL request through sniffing without the need to insert an agent program for information collection into the web application server. The access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can also easily identify an SQL executed by an application user by connecting the relation between the SQL request and the URL request obtained through an intuitive mapping algorithm. Accordingly, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server supports performance analysis of an application module and a security function, such as abuse detection to execute the performance analysis of the application module and the security function without inserting the agent program for information collection into the web application server. Therefore, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can fundamentally block the generation of an existing fatal problem, such as performance degradation and a failure of the web application server caused by excessive resource use of the web application server by the agent program for information collection. Moreover, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can contribute to an increase of the resource availability of the web application server.",present invention relates access management apparatus managing database access based web application server method thereof specifically present invention relates access management apparatus managing database access based web application server method thereof prevent performance degradation web application server automatically mapping relation uniform resource locator url request structured query language sql request transmitted based url request web application server receiving url request session connection user terminal without using resource web application server access management apparatus managing database access based web application server obtains url request sql request sniffing without need insert agent program information collection web application server access management apparatus managing database access based web application server also easily identify sql executed application user connecting relation sql request url request obtained intuitive mapping algorithm accordingly access management apparatus managing database access based web application server support performance analysis application module security function abuse detection execute performance analysis application module security function without inserting agent program information collection web application server therefore access management apparatus managing database access based web application server fundamentally block generation existing fatal problem performance degradation failure web application server caused excessive resource use web application server agent program information collection moreover access management apparatus managing database access based web application server contribute increase resource availability web application server,2

"An aircraft window shade includes protective transparent window panels, a shade driven by an electric motor, an integral control panel, and support for remote operation. The shade uses dual sprocket drive for positive shade positioning, low wear, and low parts count. The moving shade element remains substantially flat, curving slightly during some phases of positioning. The apparatus replaces a conventional interior window panel and a manual shade with slight change in overall mechanism thickness and weight. Control electronics in the shade can accept a command from a cabin attendant's console to override the local setting and move the shade to a required position, such as fully open for takeoff. The shade supports use of two or more independent shades, each of which can be made of dimming (transparent), diffusing (translucent), or light blocking (opaque) material. The shade is compatible with electrochromic transmittance control technology.",aircraft window shade includes protective transparent window panel shade driven electric motor integral control panel support remote operation shade us dual sprocket drive positive shade positioning low wear low part count moving shade element remains substantially flat curving slightly phase positioning apparatus replaces conventional interior window panel manual shade slight change overall mechanism thickness weight control electronics shade accept command cabin attendant console override local setting move shade required position fully open takeoff shade support use two independent shade made dimming transparent diffusing translucent light blocking opaque material shade compatible electrochromic transmittance control technology,-1
