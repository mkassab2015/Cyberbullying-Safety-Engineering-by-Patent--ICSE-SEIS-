The system includes two main components: (1) A representation learning network that encodes the social media session by exploiting multi-modal features, e.g., text, network, and time; and (2) a multi-task learning network that simultaneously fits the comment inter-arrival times and estimates the bullying likelihood based on a Gaussian Mixture Model. The system jointly optimizes the parameters of both components to overcome the shortcomings of decoupled training. The system includes an unsupervised cyberbullying detection model that not only experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised models, but also achieves competitive performance compared to supervised models.",UNIV ARIZONA STATE,CHENG LU;;SHU KAI;;WU SIQI;;SILVA YASIN;;HALL DEBORAH;;LIU HUAN,ARIZONA BOARD OF REGENTS ON BEHALF OF ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY (2021-12-13),https://lens.org/118-365-795-064-615,Granted Patent,yes,8,1,2,118-365-795-064-615;;010-971-865-578-536,US,2,118-365-795-064-615;;010-971-865-578-536,US,0,H04L51/212;;H04L51/52;;G06F40/30;;G06N3/088;;H04W4/21;;H04L67/535;;H04L67/12;;H04L63/1416;;H04W12/122;;H04W12/02;;G06N7/01;;G06N3/045;;G06N3/088;;G06F40/30;;H04L51/52;;H04L51/212;;H04L67/535,H04L51/52;;G06F40/30;;G06N3/088;;H04L51/212;;H04L67/50,,49,32,009-452-389-564-781;;105-628-124-791-483;;000-524-338-757-738;;033-517-058-970-421;;004-267-029-023-029;;058-813-191-543-190;;186-086-735-899-164;;044-796-964-865-82X;;063-914-220-955-770;;186-544-873-830-195;;143-105-301-792-715;;091-806-637-756-31X;;048-249-209-016-325;;011-040-688-641-91X;;068-683-846-182-729;;111-871-854-204-372;;060-702-721-304-921;;130-372-234-026-387;;081-714-175-922-49X;;112-486-338-820-828;;058-562-443-073-444;;062-730-052-235-738;;092-357-374-991-865;;084-020-298-738-900;;005-277-714-330-735;;088-581-092-017-871;;016-793-797-069-447;;041-994-550-804-558;;023-773-604-066-385;;017-169-476-606-480;;058-918-036-879-234;;154-353-812-193-396,10.1145/1541880.1541882;;10.1145/3091478.3091487;;10.1613/jair.953;;10.1145/3308560.3316503;;10.24963/ijcai.2019/808;;10.1145/3289600.3291037;;10.1007/978-3-319-71249-9_4;;10.1109/icpr.2016.7899672;;10.1145/2362394.2362400;;10.1609/icwsm.v5i3.14209;;10.1111/1467-8624.00531;;12625446;;10.1111/j.1468-2958.2012.01442.x;;10.1145/3366424.3385771;;10.1007/978-3-319-27433-1_4;;10.1109/asonam.2016.7752233;;10.1145/2661126.2661133;;10.7551/mitpress/7443.003.0014;;10.1609/icwsm.v12i1.15022;;10.18653/v1/d19-1482;;10.1145/2808797.2809381;;10.1007/s13278-016-0398-x;;10.1145/3110025.3110049;;10.1109/kst.2017.7886127;;10.24963/ijcai.2019/465;;10.1111/1467-9450.00040;;10.1007/s13278-018-0496-z;;10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x;;18363945;;10.1609/icwsm.v12i1.15046;;10.1016/s0169-7439(97)00061-0;;10.1111/j.1467-9507.2009.00544.x;;10.18653/v1/n16-1174;;10.1609/icwsm.v14i1.7345,"Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2016.

More specifically, the present invention relates to the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server and the method thereof, which prevent performance degradation of a web application server by automatically mapping a relation between a uniform resource locator (URL) request and a structured query language (SQL) request transmitted based on the URL request by the web application server receiving the URL request through session connection with a user terminal, without using a resource of the web application server. The access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server obtains the URL request and the SQL request through sniffing without the need to insert an agent program for information collection into the web application server. The access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can also easily identify an SQL executed by an application user by connecting the relation between the SQL request and the URL request obtained through an intuitive mapping algorithm. Accordingly, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server supports performance analysis of an application module and a security function, such as abuse detection to execute the performance analysis of the application module and the security function without inserting the agent program for information collection into the web application server. Therefore, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can fundamentally block the generation of an existing fatal problem, such as performance degradation and a failure of the web application server caused by excessive resource use of the web application server by the agent program for information collection. Moreover, the access management apparatus for managing database access based on a web application server can contribute to an increase of the resource availability of the web application server.",SINSIWAY CO LTD,CHUNG JAEHUN,,https://lens.org/193-757-729-771-074,Granted Patent,no,5,0,1,193-757-729-771-074,KR,1,193-757-729-771-074,KR,0,,G06F21/62;;G06F21/60;;H04L65/40,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
